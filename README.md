# üêæ Zoo Management Project (Python OOP)
As part of my computer science degree, I collaborated with a classmate on a Zoo Management System project. The main objective was to demonstrate a solid understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python.

In this project, we designed and implemented multiple interconnected classes that represented different entities in a zoo, such as:

Animals (with subclasses for specific species)

Enclosures

Zoo staff

Feeding schedules, and more

The system emphasized the use of core OOP concepts, including:

Encapsulation ‚Äì managing internal state through well-defined class interfaces

Inheritance ‚Äì creating hierarchies of animal types with shared and specialized behaviors

Polymorphism ‚Äì enabling flexible interactions between different object types

Abstraction ‚Äì modeling real-world zoo behavior in a simplified, structured way

The project was built entirely in Python, and was designed to be modular, readable, and easy to expand. It reflects good coding practices and demonstrates the ability to break down a real-world problem into manageable and reusable components using object-oriented design.
